World-Check is a risk intelligence database maintained by Refinitiv, which provides detailed information to help businesses, financial institutions, and government agencies manage financial, regulatory, and reputational risks. The database includes profiles of individuals and entities that may pose a risk, including information on:

1. **Sanctions**: Individuals and entities listed on international sanctions lists.
2. **Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)**: Individuals who hold or have held prominent public positions and their close associates.
3. **Adverse Media**: Entities and individuals mentioned in negative media coverage.
4. **Enforcement**: Those involved in regulatory enforcement actions or other legal proceedings.
5. **Financial Crime**: Information on money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud, and other financial crimes.
6. **Watch Lists**: Persons or entities on law enforcement and regulatory watch lists.

Businesses use World-Check to screen customers, clients, and partners to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations. This helps mitigate risks by identifying potential connections to illegal activities or other reputational risks.
