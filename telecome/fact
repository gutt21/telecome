Yes, the description accurately captures the primary functions and uses of the FactSet application as utilized by the three teams at CNB. Here is a refined version for clarity:

The FactSet application is primarily used by three teams at CNB:

1. **Data Team**: This team manages all fundamental financial data, including equities, fixed income, price data, macroeconomic data, and other relevant information. They download data from the FactSet application, which serves as the primary data source to support the organization in various functions such as client reporting, performance analysis, accounting, and business operations.

2. **Portfolio Management Team**: This team is responsible for managing clients' portfolios. They need to understand clients' positions and handle all aspects of portfolio allocation and management, ensuring that the portfolios are well-balanced and aligned with clients' investment goals.

3. **Research and US Equity Management Team**: This team is responsible for both research and the management of US equity and US equity income. The research team uses FactSet for fundamental and quantitative analysis, performance attribution, and strategy evaluation. They analyze why a strategy is working, identify contributing and detracting factors, determine the sources of alpha, and assess risks. Additionally, they perform performance attribution related to core equity and equity income strategies and use FactSet for alpha testing and backtesting.

This summary accurately represents how FactSet supports the various functions within these teams at CNB.
