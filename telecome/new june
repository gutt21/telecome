**LexisNexis:**

The Compliance and Regulatory Bureau (CNB) uses the LexisNexis application for various investigative purposes. It helps them investigate data and financial activities. The compliance team uses it to review and verify accounts on their website. If they need more information about these accounts, they log into LexisNexis to query the necessary data. This includes obtaining information for investigating potential fraud and suspicious activities.

The application helps the CNB gather essential information such as addresses, personal records, and business profiles.
