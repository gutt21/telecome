Exacq EM (Enterprise Manager) is a software tool used for managing multiple Exacq video management system (VMS) servers and their associated video surveillance devices. It provides centralized monitoring, management, and reporting for large-scale video security systems. Key features of Exacq EM include:

1. **Centralized Management**: Allows administrators to manage and configure multiple Exacq servers and devices from a single interface.
  
2. **Health Monitoring**: Monitors the health and status of all connected devices, such as cameras and storage systems, alerting administrators to any issues.

3. **User Management**: Facilitates centralized user management, including adding or removing users, setting permissions, and controlling access to video feeds.

4. **Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on system usage, device status, and other operational metrics.

5. **Scalability**: Designed to scale with the needs of large organizations, supporting hundreds or thousands of devices across multiple locations.

Exacq EM is often used in large organizations or environments where security and surveillance are critical, such as in corporate campuses, retail chains, and government facilities.
